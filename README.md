# Atmos Take Home Project

## Tech Stack

- React as SPA framework

- Redux as global state manager

## Functionality

### Mock API and Data

- The app consumes all data on initial render of the `App` component
- The Mock API is invoked by means of reducer actions which immediately add the data to the redux store
- Further development would involve refactoring the mock API and Redux Store to deliver and process promises, respectively

### Basic Layout

-

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
